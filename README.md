# text-app
CRUD Text api for legal doctrine coding challenge

## Steps

- npm install
- npm run dev: for running the server at development mode
- npm test: for testing the app

### PS

I deleted the .env from gitignore just so you could test with my config variables. 

I used ES5 instead of ES6 because most testing frameworks have issues with ES6 modules (import / exports)
